# Kigali_Waste_Management_System
The Kigali waste management system is a project completed as a final project in Machine Leaning to get a certificate from Kigali AI Saturday.
The project aim to assist in waste management project where a trained machine learning model facilitate in separation of waste.
Waste are categorized in two main groups, R which is stands for recyclable waste like plastics, clothes, metals, etc. Thus, those waste products will be easily identifyied from other waste and be placed aside for further activities like recyling process.
Another category is o stands for Organic, these are waste that are biodegradable, they can be used for making useful products like fertilizers.
I have used Images as data to train the model which is Tensolflow.
Several dependencies, CV2, and other Python libraries were used to build this computer vision model that will identify and separate images of waste.
